<h3 align="center">Wine Quality Prediction Tool</h3>

## Introduction

This is a wine quality estimate ML model in Spark over AWS. The model is ready in arranged on different EC2 cases. Then, the model is saved and stacked in an application that will perform wine quality conjecture. The whole application is easy to send by a docker picture worked for clients (benevolently see <a href="https://github.com/keerthikondisetty/cs643-wineTaster/blob/main/wineTaster.pdf">user guide</a> for additional information). The precision is 84.6% in ordinary.

## Tech Stack of the project

* Apache Spark - train an ML model in parallel on multiple **EC2** instances
* **Amazon AWS** - parallel machine learning (ML) applications platform
* **Spark’s MLlib** - use an ML model in the cloud
* **Docker** - create a container for ML model to simplify model deployment
* **Python** - coding lenguage
